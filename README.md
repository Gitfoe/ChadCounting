ChatCounting is a Discord bot designed to facilitate collaborative counting on your server. With its focus on accuracy and reliability, ChatCounting is the ideal choice for gigachads looking to push their counting abilities to the limit. In contrast to other counting bots, ChatCounting is specifically optimized to minimize missed counts and keep track of the latest count, making it the perfect tool for your server's counting needs.

### [Click here to add the bot to your server/guild](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1066081427935993886&permissions=67648&scope=bot)

## Features
- Counting from 1 to âˆž (actually the 32-bit integer) in a specific Discord channel
- Users cannot count twice in a row, go backwards in count or skip a count
- Works seamlessly on multiple servers
- Saves the count data to a JSON database
- Keeps track of the high score
- Bot catches up to missed counts in the channel if people counted while the bot was off
- As long as the message starts with a number, the bot counts it

## Usage
To configue the bot for the first time, add it to your Discord server and use the `/setchannel` command to let the bot know where it should keep track of counting. After that the bot is up and running.

## Commands
The following commands could be used:
- `/setchannel`: sets the counting channel the bot will be active in.
- `/checkcount`: checks the current count in case you think someone might have deleted or edited their message.
- `/checkhighscore`: shows the current high score and the difference between the current count and the high score.

## Developer stuff
### Dependencies
To run the Python program, the following two dependencies need to be installed via pip:
```
pip3 install -U discord.py
pip3 install -U dotenv
```
### Discord Developer Portal bot settings
Create your own bot and ensure it has the `Send Message`, `Read Message History` and `Add Reactions` OAuth2 permissions. The scope should be `bot`.

### Environment tables
In the root of the ChadCounting bot folder (in the same folder as `bot.py`), create a `.env` file. Add the token of your Discord bot like this:
```
# .env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
```
